# Mechanical Engineer | R&D Specialist

Soon to be Ph.D. Mechanical Engineer with a passion for energy efficiency. I’m at my best in chaotic, hands-on situations where things aren’t working, and no one can figure out why—there’s nothing like the thrill of solving tough problems and uncovering hidden insights. I love diving into data analysis, but I also need to get my hands dirty with instruments now and then. After all, if there's no risk of something blowing up, where’s the fun?

With experience in experimental research, carbon capture, parametric benchmarking, and instrumentation, I’m seeking an R&D role where I can push boundaries and make a real impact in the energy sector.
